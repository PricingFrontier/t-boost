"""Check that PyPI serves exactly the release files the Release run built.

The Release workflow uploads with already-present files skipped, so re-running a
failed publish completes a partial upload instead of failing on the file that
made it. The release counts as published, and is tagged, only once PyPI's JSON
for the version lists every built file with the same SHA-256 and nothing else.
